## Recipe

Servings: 3

### Ingredients

* 120 g oat flour
* 85 g soy protein from Trader Joe's, unflavored (see blog post for substitutions)
* 85 g olive oil
* 75 g brown sugar
* 25 g ground flax
* 20 g cocoa powder
* 15 g lecithin
* up to 10 g potassium citrate or 20 g potassium gluconate, added gradually (1 g per batch)
* 2 g iodized salt
* 1 g Emergen-C
* 1 Vitamin D supplement

### Method

0. Combine all dry ingredients except Vitamin D. Mix well.
0. Measure olive oil into a separate container.
0. To prepare an individual meal, measure about a third of the dry mix and a third of the oil into a large drinking vessel.
0. Add 400-500 ml (14-16 oz) of water, and shake or stir well.
0. Chill for several hours if possible, to improve taste and texture. It may be healthier that way too (due to phytic acid deactivation).
